The purpose of this app was to explore how well I could target subscribers to a specific operator.

Trying to match either SubscriberID/name (from the SIM-card) AND or OR the IP-range to ISP.

It downloads both ip -> AS-number mappings as well ass AS-number -> AS-name mappings from http://thyme.apnic.net/current/
